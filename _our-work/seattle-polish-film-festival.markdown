Polish cinema has a historic vibrancy and relevancy—not to mention a history of vibrant and relevant film posters. Indeed, the medium of the poster has seen some of its best and most iconic works in Polish cinema. 

The goal of creating a design for the SPFF was to seek a solution that communicates both the rich heritage of Polish film  and the high quality of the world’s top festivals. The solution borrows the bold white and red of the Polish flag via typographic means. It also captures the sense of a rapidly moving motion picture itself. Festival details remain prominently at the top of the design, while the bird, a symbol of Poland’s coat of arms, signifies a stamp of prestige and quality.
