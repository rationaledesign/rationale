excerpt_text: 'For Canadian travel agency Fresh Tracks Canada and its sub-brands,
  Rationale refined the company''s logo and identity system to reflect three primary
  elements: the Canadian maple leaf in its distinctive red, the motion of travel,
  and the “fresh track” of nature’s bounty via the hollowed-out shape of the interior.
  Slightly rounded corners give a friendly appearance and are a nod to the soft edges
  of nature.'

For Canadian travel agency [Fresh Tracks Canada](https://freshtrackscanada.com/) and its sub-brands, Rationale refined the company's logo and identity system to reflect three primary elements: the Canadian maple leaf in its distinctive red, the motion of travel, and the “fresh track” of nature’s bounty via the hollowed-out shape of the interior. Slightly rounded corners give a friendly appearance and are a nod to the soft edges of nature.

The design approach extends well in digital and physical applications to a consistent and robust effect. The strong, focused messaging, ample white space, and contrast of elements continue this refined voice.
