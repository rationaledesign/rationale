Smith Interiors is a floor covering business specializing in both residential and commercial sales and installation of hardwoods, carpet, tile, and more. 
The company, in business since 1975, has strong and well-developed small-town roots. The identityâ€™s approach is centered around the modular blocks of the Smith Interiors mark. These blocks resemble the quality materials used by the company and the precision of their craftsmanship honed by years of experience.
