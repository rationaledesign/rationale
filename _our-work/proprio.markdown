For medical imaging and technology company [Proprio](http://propriovision.com), we created a bold and nuanced visual identity system that reflects the spirit and process of what they do. A design language of geometric forms, technical imagery, and kinetic, transforming hexagons merges with overlaying colors that reflect a sight into the unseen.
