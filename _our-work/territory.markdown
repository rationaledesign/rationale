Cover and singles for the Territory EP, designed for music group The Fascination Movement. The imagery brings a strong design of sequential elements converging and diverging. 

Artwork leverages the same approach and use of color and grid for the EP singles, representing the songsâ€™ subjects in a conceptual and unified graphical manner.
