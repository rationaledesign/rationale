The poster for the 2016 GiveBig campaign for the Seattle Design Foundation was created to promote philanthropic donations in support of the SDF and its mission: to foster innovation in emerging talent by selecting individuals to receive small, project-focused grants matched with mentorship.

The design conveys the concept of growth, upward motion, light, and transformation, while building on the existing SDF identity.
