For global shaving brand [Schick](https://www.schick.com/), Rationale designed a new logomark, visual identity, packaging, and advertising typography in collaboration with [Partners & Spade](https://partnersandspade.com/) who led strategy, messaging, and advertising efforts, with campaign commercials directed by film director [Mike Mills](https://mikemillsmikemills.com/).

Where disconnectedness and random imagery once dominated, the new identity system provides a clean and distinct look that creates a break in the shaving aisle and other touchpoints & demands attention while simultaneously conveying an authentic brand voice for all current and future products.
