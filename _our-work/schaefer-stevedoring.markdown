In the space of transport, particularly for the maritime industry, there is an overwhelming richness of history and metaphors to embrace. As such, a maritime company’s visual identity has great opportunity to distinguish itself from competitors as superior and state-of-the-art. This was our goal with the identity and logomark we developed for Schaefer Stevedoring.
