We reenvisioned the Hot Rod & Classic Car Show in historic Snohomish, Washington, USA to direct focus to the beauty of cars’ details themselves. The close-up photography is paired with a bold typographic treatment that entices one to come and “See More” at the annual event.

Limited-edition poster designed by Sean Wolcott of Rationale. Giclée printed at A1 large-format size on enhanced matte paper in deep and vibrant colors. Signed and numbered on the back by the designer. Shipped in a heavy-duty mailing tube ready to be framed or hung as is.
